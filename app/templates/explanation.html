<h3>To find the solution to procrastination, we must first look for the root cause.</h3>
</div>
<br>
<div class="wordPic">
<h6>The <strong>Temporal Motivation Theory</strong> is a theory developed by Piers Steel and Cornelius J. König which encapsulates the 4 main root causes of procrastination.</h6>
</div>
<ul>
    <li>Self-efficacy</li>
    <li>Value of task</li>
    <li>Distractibility</li>
    <li>Delay of task</li>

</ul>
<br>
<div>
<h6><strong>Self-efficacy</strong>: People with more self-efficacy believe they can perform the task, making them have greater expectations of success. On the other hand, those with low self-efficacy don’t have much confidence they can perform the task successfully This makes them lower their expectations of success; self-efficacy has a negative relationship with procrastination.

<div>
<h6><strong>Value of task</strong>: It is made up of three subsections, task aversiveness (people avoiding unpleasant tasks), need for achievement, and boredom proneness(likelihood of tasks found boring increases). </h6>

<div>
<h6><strong>Distractibility</strong>: Distractions will make people prone to setting off tasks and adding delay to the completion of tasks.</h6>
